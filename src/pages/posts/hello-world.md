# Hello World

This is the first post on Once Upon an Ipsum. I plan to use Once Upon an Ipsum to share odds and ends about programming on the web and as an outlet to develop side projects in public.

The site is primarily built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The site source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/mambroz27/onceuponanipsum) and deployed with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

## Starting with HUGO

I started this project with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) and quickly found I just didn't like it. In a professional setting sometimes you have to use tools you don't like, but for a personal project I'd rather use something I enjoy, there were small things in HUGO that didn't fit with my preferences in the developer experience. I don't want to dig into the things I didn't like because I don't want to give the impression that HUGO is bad. It's not. It just wasn't for me.

## Moving to Astro

I had been following Astro for a while and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did, Astro is a joy to work with. I'm especially excited for the integrations available, like [React](https://reactjs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), and more. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is also a huge plus. I'm planning to showcase development challenges I encounter with other frameworks and Astro makes it easy to drop in components from other frameworks in the middle of my static site.
