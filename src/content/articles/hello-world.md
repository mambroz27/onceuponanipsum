Welcome to the inaugural post on Once Upon an Ipsum. This platform serves as a space where I'll be sharing miscellaneous insights about web programming. Additionally, it will serve as a public outlet for me to cultivate side projects.

The website is predominantly constructed using the powerful combination of [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mambroz27/onceuponanipsum) and deployed through [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

## Initial Steps with HUGO

Initially, I embarked on this project using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io), but it swiftly became apparent that it didn't align with my preferences. While it's common to work with tools one may not particularly enjoy in a professional setting, for a personal project, I believe it's crucial to work with tools that bring joy. There were nuances in HUGO that didn't resonate with my ideal developer experience. However, it's important to note that this isn't a critique of HUGO itself, as it serves its purpose well for many other developers.

## Transition to Astro

Having kept an eye on Astro for some time, I eventually made the switch and haven't looked back since. Working with Astro has been an absolute delight. Its versatile integrations with other frameworks such as [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) have been particularly exciting. Furthermore, the inclusion of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is a very exciting prospect. I plan to showcase the challenges I encounter while developing various projects, and Astro's flexibility makes it seamless to incorporate components from other frameworks within my static site.
